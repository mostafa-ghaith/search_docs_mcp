# Search Docs MCP

![Search Docs MCP Banner](search_docs_mcp_banner_pixel.png)

Ever found yourself in a situation where your coding angel (or agent) stares blankly at you when you ask about the latest AI library? ü§î That's because they're still catching up with the training data from 2023! 

This MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool is your secret weapon against outdated knowledge. It enables semantic search across multiple AI library documentations, ensuring your coding companion stays up-to-date with the latest tech. No more "I'm sorry, I don't have information about that" moments!

Simply configure your favorite libraries in the config file, and let your coding angel do the heavy lifting of finding the exact information you need from the official docs. It's like giving your AI assistant a direct line to the source of truth! üöÄ

> Special thanks to [Alejandro AO](https://github.com/alejandro-ao) for his wonderful tutorial on creating MCP servers. This project was inspired by his work and uses his implementation patterns.

## Features

- üîç Search across multiple AI library documentations:
  - LangChain - A framework for developing applications powered by language models
  - LangGraph - A library for building complex AI workflows
  - CrewAI - A framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents
  - LlamaIndex - A data framework for LLM applications
  - OpenAI - Official documentation for OpenAI's API and models
- ‚ö° Fast and efficient search using Serper API
- üéØ Accurate results with semantic search capabilities
- üîÑ Real-time documentation fetching
- üõ†Ô∏è Easy integration with MCP-based applications
- ‚öôÔ∏è Easy configuration for adding new documentation sources

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Serper API key (for web search functionality)
- MCP SDK 1.2.0 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mostafa-ghaith/search-docs-mcp.git
cd search-docs-mcp
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Serper API key:
```
SERPER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Configuration

The tool uses a configuration file (`config.py`) to manage documentation sources. You can easily add new documentation sources by editing this file:

```python
DOCS_CONFIG = {
    "new_library": {
        "url": "docs.new-library.com",
        "description": "Description of the new library"
    }
}
```

## Usage

### As an MCP Server

The tool can be used as part of an MCP-based application. Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("docs")

# The tool will be available as part of your MCP application
# You can search documentation like this:
result = await mcp.get_docs(query="Chroma DB", library="langchain")
```

### Connecting to Claude Desktop or Cursor

1. For Claude Desktop:
   - Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
   ```json
   {
       "mcpServers": {
           "search-docs-mcp": {
               "command": "uv",
               "args": [
                   "--directory",
                   "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/YOUR/search-docs-mcp",
                   "run",
                   "main.py"
               ]
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. For Cursor:
   - Navigate to Cursor Settings
   - Open the MCP tab
   - Click on "Add new global MCP server"
   - Add the server configuration similar to Claude Desktop

3. Restart the application to apply changes
