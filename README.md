# Search Docs MCP

A powerful MCP (Model Control Protocol) tool that enables semantic search across multiple AI library documentations. This tool helps you quickly find relevant information from popular AI libraries' documentation.

## Features

- üîç Search across multiple AI library documentations:
  - LangChain - A framework for developing applications powered by language models
  - LangGraph - A library for building complex AI workflows
  - CrewAI - A framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents
  - LlamaIndex - A data framework for LLM applications
  - OpenAI - Official documentation for OpenAI's API and models
- ‚ö° Fast and efficient search using Serper API
- üéØ Accurate results with semantic search capabilities
- üîÑ Real-time documentation fetching
- üõ†Ô∏è Easy integration with MCP-based applications
- ‚öôÔ∏è Easy configuration for adding new documentation sources

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Serper API key (for web search functionality)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/search-docs-mcp.git
cd search-docs-mcp
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Serper API key:
```
SERPER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Configuration

The tool uses a configuration file (`config.py`) to manage documentation sources. You can easily add new documentation sources by editing this file:

```python
DOCS_CONFIG = {
    "new_library": {
        "url": "docs.new-library.com",
        "description": "Description of the new library"
    }
}
```

## Usage

The tool can be used as part of an MCP-based application. Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("docs")

# The tool will be available as part of your MCP application
# You can search documentation like this:
result = await mcp.get_docs(query="Chroma DB", library="langchain")
```

## API Reference

### `get_docs(query: str, library: str)`

Search documentation for a specific query in a given library.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (str): The search query (e.g., "Chroma DB")
- `library` (str): The library to search in (see config.py for supported libraries)

**Returns:**
- Text content from the relevant documentation pages

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request. When adding new documentation sources, please update the `config.py` file with the appropriate URL and description.
